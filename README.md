StochasticDiffEq.jl is a component package in the DifferentialEquations ecosystem. It holds the
stochastic differential equations solvers and utilities. While completely independent
and usable on its own, users interested in using this
functionality should check out [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl).
